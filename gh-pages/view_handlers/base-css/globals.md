## HTML5 doctype

Romo requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Include it at the beginning of all your projects:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

## Reset with Normalize

Romo uses [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) to reset the CSS.  From their website:

> Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
